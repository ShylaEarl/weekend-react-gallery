# Project Name

React Gallery

## Description

Duration: Weekend Challenge

This project displays a gallery of images and allows the user to click a 'like' button and see how many 'likes' each image has recieved. This project also allows the user to click on the image toggling between the image and a description of it. The user may also add a new image to the gallery and/or delete one. 

The problem solved by this project is that users can create an interactive gallery of images that are relevant to them, adding, updating, and deleting images as desired. The ability to interact with the images either by 'liking' them or by toggling the images to reveal a description increases accessibility for users who may need and/or prefer a description of the image. These problems are solved by making both the images and buttons interactive for the user.
