# Project Name

React Gallery

## Description

Duration: Weekend Challenge

This project displays a gallery of images and allows the user to click a 'like' button and see how many 'likes' each images has recieved. This project also allows the user to click on the image, removing it while revealing a description of the image.

The problem solved by this project is the users ability to interact with the images either by 'liking' them or by removing the images to reveal an image description, thereby, increasing accessibility for users who may need and/or prefer a description of the image. These problems are solved by making both the image (on click event) and like button (on click event) interactive for the user.
